# Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description

This project is about building a timed quiz with multiple-choice questions. The CSS and HTML files were given to me, so my challenge is to create the JavaScript files.

This quiz must comply with the following requirements:

* A start button that when is clicked, a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions with buttons for each answer.
  * When an answer is clicked, the next question appears.
  * If the answer clicked is incorrect, then subtract 10 seconds from the timer.

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it should display the user score and give the ability to save their initials and their score.

This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by my JavaScript code. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

Here is a link to the deployed application:

## Installation

Clone the project and open it using your favourite browser (I recommend using Chrome).

## Usage

My web application should resemble this following animation that demonstrates the application functionality:

User adds their intials, then clears their intials and starts over.](assets/08-web-apis-challenge-demo.gif)
